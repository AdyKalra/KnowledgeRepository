### * The Greatest Salesman In The World - Og Mandino

It's a beautiful story of Hafid, a poor camel boy. Surprisingly you can interpret the book the way you like, its less about sales and more about secret scrolls of success and yet it is about sales.
#### The Scroll marked VIII 
Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.
A mulberry leaf touched with the genius of man becomes silk.
A field of clay touched with the genius of man becomes a castle.
A cyprus tree touched with the genius of man becomes a shrine.
A cut of sheep's hair touched with the genius of man becomes raiment for a king.
If it is possible for leaves and clay and wood and hair to have their value multiplied a hundred, yea a thousandfold by man, cannot I do the same with the clay which bears my name?
