### [What de-scaling an organization meant! It's really interesting to see how companies have adopted these metrics](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exponential-business-agility-xscale-practice-pattern-language-merel/) 
### Maximum Meeting Size (MMS), Minimum Feedback Frequency (MFF) and Delegation/Collaboration Ratio (DCR). 
* MMS is the largest number of people you need to put in a room to get any decision made across your organization. 
* MFF is the longest any decision stands unreviewed in your organization. 
* DCR is the ratio between the average number of people the organization delegates decisions to vs. the number of people who collaborate on making decisions face-to-face.
